title: How to receive assets?
---

Portkey supports the effortless management of your crypto assets. You can receive crypto assets within the aelf network and from other networks including Ethereum, Solana, and TON.

### To receive tokens within the aelf network (for instance from other Portkey accounts or other wallets on aelf)

1. Tap the "Receive" button on the Portkey home screen and select the token you wish to receive.
2. Choose the "Source" and "Destination" networks, either aelf MainChain or aelf dAppChain.
3. After selecting the networks, your wallet address and a QR code will be displayed. Share the address with the sender or have the sender scan the QR code to complete the transfer.
   * Note: Make sure the sender's account matches the source network to avoid asset loss.
4. Once the transfer is complete, check your balance for updates. Your assets will appear in your account shortly.

> If you receive ELF from exchanges like Binance or MEXC, ensure you select aelf MainChain as both the "Source" and "Destination" network. Supported exchanges for Mainnet ELF token transfers to Portkey wallet include Binance, OKX, Upbit, Bithumb, Gate, MEXC, and Hotcoin.

> Only send ELF tokens from the above exchanges, as other tokens are not supported and will result in asset loss.

### To receive tokens cross-chain from other networks (for instance Ethereum or Solana)

If you want to **receive ELF, USDT, and SGR with a value of less than $20,000**, follow the instructions below.

1. Tap the "Receive" button on the Portkey home screen and select the token you wish to receive, for example, ELF, or USDT.
2. Choose the "Destination" network, either aelf MainChain or aelf dAppChain. For the "Source" network, you can select from the list of supported blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and TON.
3. After selecting the networks, your wallet address and a QR code will be displayed. Share the address with the sender or have the sender scan the QR code to complete the transfer.
   * Note: Make sure the sender's account matches the source network to avoid asset loss.
4. Once the transfer is complete, check your balance for updates. Your assets will appear in your account shortly.

If you want to **receive ETH, BNB, USDC, and DAI, or receive ELF, USDT, and SGR with a value of $20,000 or more**, follow the instructions below.

1. Tap the "Receive" button on the Portkey home screen and select the token you wish to receive, for example, ETH, or USDC.
2. Choose the "Destination" network, either aelf MainChain or aelf dAppChain. For the "Source" network, you can select from the list of blockchains supported, including Ethereum and BSC.
3. After selecting the networks, you'll be prompted to connect external wallets like MetaMask to bridge the asset. Once you have connected the external wallet, enter the amount you'd like to receive and click "Preview".
4. Check transaction details such as the sender and network. If all is correct, click "Bridge to aelf" to finalise.
   * Note: Once you click the button, the transaction is irreversible. Make sure all details are accurate before you proceed.
5. Once the transfer is complete, check your balance for updates. Your assets will appear in your account shortly.

> Depending on the asset and source network, cross-chain transfers are facilitated by either ETransfer or eBridge, both integrated into Portkey to give you a smooth user experience.
