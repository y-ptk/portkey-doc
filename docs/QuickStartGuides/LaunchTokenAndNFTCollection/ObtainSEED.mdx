# Obtain SEED

## What is SEED

SEED is a special NFT item issued by aelf. Projects can obtain SEED through purchasing, auctioning, or application processes via the Symbol Market. Each SEED can be used to create a token or NFT collection. Wallet addresses holding the SEED can initiate the creation of tokens or NFT collections through the Symbol Market or the NFT marketplaces within the aelf ecosystem, thereby proceeding to the issuance phase.

The information stored in a SEED's external info represents the details needed to create a token. This information represents the symbol of the token or NFT collection that the SEED can be utilized to create. In the aelf ecosystem, the symbol serves as the unique identifier for tokens, ensuring their authenticity.
