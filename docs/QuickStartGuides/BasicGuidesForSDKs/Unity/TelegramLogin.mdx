# Authenticate using Telegram

You can let your users authenticate with Portkey using their Telegram ID by using the Portkey SDK for sign-in flow.

## Access the PortkeySDK.AuthService

The `AuthService` class is the entry point for all authentication API calls. It is accessible through `PortkeySDK.AuthService`.

```csharp
IAuthService auth = PortkeySDK.AuthService;
```

## Authenticate with PortkeySDK

1. User is to get a Telegram Credential by signing in to their Telegram ID through the `TelegramCredentialProvider`.

```csharp
// mySuccessCallback will be called when a Credential is successfully returned by TelegramCredentialProvider.
PortkeySDK.AuthService.TelegramCredentialProvider.Get(mySuccessCallback);
```

2. After getting Telegram Credential, we will check if the user has already signed up with the corresponding Telegram Credential before. A user who already has an account with Portkey should have one or more Guardians returned from the callback.

```csharp
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.GetGuardians(telegramCredential, guardians =>
{
    if(guardians.Count == 0)
    {
        // No guardians, have never signed up before...
    }
    else
    {
        // Has a Portkey account...
    }
}));
```

3. Depending if the user has a Portkey account, we can either sign up or login.

 - Sign up flow

  1. Sign in for the user through the `SignUp` function. A `DIDAccountInfo` will be returned after a successful sign up that contains the signing key and account information for the user.
```csharp
  StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.SignUp(telegramCredential, didAccountInfo => 
  {
      // user has successfully signed up and his info can be found in DIDAccountInfo
  }));
```

 - Login flow

  1. Get the amount of approved Guardians that is required to login the user.
```csharp
  int requiredApprovedGuardians = PortkeySDK.AuthService.GetRequiredApprovedGuardiansCount(guardians.Count);
```

  2. Verify the Guardians through `AuthService` to get `ApprovedGuardians` for the login.
```csharp
  List<ApprovedGuardian> approvedGuardians = new List<ApprovedGuardian>();

  for (int i = 0; i < requiredApprovedGuardians; ++i)
  {
      StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Verify(guardians[i], approvedGuardian =>
      {
          approvedGuardians.Add(approvedGuardian);
      }));
  }
```

  3. Use the `ApprovedGuardians` to login the user.
```csharp
  StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Login(guardians[0], approvedGuardians, didAccountInfo =>
  {
      // user is logged in and his info and signing key can be found in DIDAccountInfo
  }));
```

## Example

The following is a sample code to authenticate a user through the whole sign up/login flow with their Telegram ID.

```csharp
using Portkey.DID;

public class TelegramLoginExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private PortkeySDK PortkeySDK;

    public void SignInWithTelegram()
    {
        PortkeySDK.AuthService.TelegramCredentialProvider.Get(credential => 
        {
            StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.GetGuardians(credential, guardians =>
            {
                if(guardians.Count == 0)
                {
                    // No guardians, proceed to sign up
                    StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.SignUp(credential, didAccountInfo => 
                    {
                        // user has successfully signed up and his info can be found in DIDAccountInfo
                    }));
                }
                else
                {
                    int requiredApprovedGuardians = PortkeySDK.AuthService.GetRequiredApprovedGuardiansCount(guardians.Count);

                    List<ApprovedGuardian> approvedGuardians = new List<ApprovedGuardian>();
                    // Guardians exist, proceed to sign in
                    for (int i = 0; i < requiredApprovedGuardians; ++i)
                    {
                        StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Verify(guardians[i], approvedGuardian =>
                        {
                            approvedGuardians.Add(approvedGuardian);
                        }));
                    }
                    
                    while(approvedGuardians.Count < requiredApprovedGuardians)
                    {
                        // wait for guardians to be approved
                    }

                    // first element of the guardians array is the login guardian
                    StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Login(guardians[0], approvedGuardians, didAccountInfo =>
                    {
                        // user is logged in and his info can be found in DIDAccountInfo
                    }));
                }
            }));
        });
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

After the user has signed up or logged in, a `DIDAccountInfo` will be returned that corresponds to the Telegram ID used to login. `DIDAccountInfo` contains signing key and account information that can be used to get a user's account balance and sign transactions.

## Sign out

To sign out a user, call `Logout`.
```csharp
StartCoroutine(PortkeySDK.AuthService.Logout());
```
