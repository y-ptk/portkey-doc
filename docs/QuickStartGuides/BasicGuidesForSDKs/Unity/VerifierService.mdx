# Verifier Service

## Overview

When users create an account or add a guardian, verifier services are needed to verify the account. 

Verifier services encompass functions such as recording, sending, and verifying verification codes as well as validating signatures.

1.  Users initiate guardian account requests through the frontend to the proxy Guardian Verifier service, such as emails or phone numbers.

1.  The proxy Guardian Verifier service handles this request:

    1.  If the request is successfully sent, it returns to the frontend with a success confirmation and VerifierSessionId.
    1.  If the request fails, it returns with an error code and error message.

    1.  If the verification fails, it returns an error code and error message to the frontend.

This is automatically done in code and developers do not need to worry about implementing.
