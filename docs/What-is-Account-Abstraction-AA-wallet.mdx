title: What is Account Abstraction (AA) wallet
---

Account Abstraction (AA) is a groundbreaking technology that enables users to use programmable wallets as on-chain accounts, eliminating the need for private key or seed phrase management while unlocking versatile functionalities.

In the current Web3 landscape, Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallets are the most common type of wallet used and rely solely on private keys and seed phrases for account control. This limits access to anyone with the keys, making it vulnerable to theft. If the keys are lost, the authentic owner can not restore the account. Additionally, EOA wallets offer limited functionalities, like token and NFT transfers, and may not cater to more customised user needs.

In contrast, AA wallets offer several key advantages:

* **Seamless Experience**: AA wallets provide a user-friendly onboarding experience for Web2 users. On-chain accounts can be created and managed using social info like phone numbers and email addresses, which means users don't need to memorise complex private keys or seed phrases anymore.
* **Enhanced Security**: AA wallets support robust security measures, including social recovery. Users can appoint trusted parties as guardians who will safeguard their accounts and assist in regaining access in the event of loss.
* **Flexible Fee Payment**: AA wallets allow the payment of transaction fees in non-native tokens, including stablecoins. Advanced configurations, such as payment delegation mechanisms, can also be coded into wallets to tailor to specific user needs.
* **Diversified Features**: In addition to these advantages, AA wallets also offer a solid foundation for more custom functionalities, including batched and scheduled transactions, accommodating a wide range of crypto wallet and Web3 usage scenarios.
