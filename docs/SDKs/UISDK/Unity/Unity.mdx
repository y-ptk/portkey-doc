You should see this screen after the following steps:

1.  Follow through Installation section of https://github.com/Portkey-Wallet/portkey-unity-sdk
1.  Open up `SampleScene`

The main UI you should look for is under `PortkeyUICanvas.prefab`. If you wish to alter its appearance, you may create a prefab variant and do the necessary.
