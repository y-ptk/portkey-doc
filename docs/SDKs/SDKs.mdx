# SDKs

## Overview

Portkey provides SDKs for a range of languages and frameworks that make it easy for application developers to execute basic, as well as more advanced, functionality.


We plan to provide two types of SDKs.

|   | Type     | Description                                                 | SDKs available              |
| - | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 1 | Core SDK | Projects can integrate by calling the API                   | TypeScriptAndroidunityios   |
| 2 | UI SDK   | Projects can conveniently integrate by directly referencing | TypeScriptAndroidcocosunity |


Portkey functionalities supported in the Core SDK and UI SDK are the same.
