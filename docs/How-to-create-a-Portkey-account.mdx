1. Open the Portkey app and tap the "Get started" button.
2. Select the type of social information you want to use for account creation and follow the on-screen instructions to complete verification.
3. Once verified, create a PIN or enable biometric authentication to secure your account and enhance the login experience.
4. Your account will be created, and you'll be directed to the Portkey homepage.

> For added security, Portkey encourages you to add more guardians before managing your assets or interacting with dApps. Follow the [tutorial for adding guardians](/docs/How-to-add-or-remove-guardians "") or learn the [importance of having multiple guardians](/docs/What-is-security-detection "").
